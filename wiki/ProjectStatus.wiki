= Current situation =

The main Open-NARS project (under http://code.google.com/p/open-nars/source/browse/#svn/trunk/nars) has been updated to version 1.5.0 in January 2013. This version has implemented NAL-1 to NAL-6 as described in [http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8665 Non-Axiomatic Logic: A Model of Intelligent Reasoning]. This version is a major refactoring of the previous version, by realizing many ideas suggested by Joe Geldart and Jeff Thompson.

= Future tasks =

As far as the main project is concerned, there are several major tasks in the near future. Interested people are welcome to participate.

== A. Testing and debugging ==

The current code of 1.5.0 has not been fully tested, and may contain bugs to be fixed.

== B. Natural language processing ==

Beside refactoring, a major motivation of this new version is to test some ideas about natural language comprehension and production. It will be explained in future writings, probably around March 2013.

== C. Further redesign ==

What is left for a future time is the idea of implementing the inference rules in a declarative manner. The current approach, mainly shown in nars.inference.RuleTables, lacks clarity and elegance, and is also hard to maintain. 

Other modular modifications may happen in GUI and input/output channels. Especially, to relate NARS and Semantic Web has be under consideration for a while.

== D. The control part ==

The resource allocation strategies of NARS need a more detailed conceptual design, then the related code will be modified.

== E. Upper layers ==

NAL-7, NAL-8, and NAL-9 will be re-implemented in version 1.5, probably in a form that is different from how they were implemented in versions 1.3.x and 1.4.0. In particular, the implementation of NAL-9 may require further refactoring of the control mechanism. This step will not be taken before May 2013.
