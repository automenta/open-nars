#summary New functions of Open-NARS version 1.6.x.

= Introduction =

Open-NARS 1.6.x is different from 1.5.x in the following major aspects:
  # In logic, it implements NAL-7, NAL-8, and NAL-9, and therefore completely implements NAL, as specified in [http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8665 Non-Axiomatic Logic: A Model of Intelligent Reasoning]. It is an attempt to re-do what [OpenNarsOneDotFour] planned to achieve.
  # In control, it refines the automatic resources allocation that has been there from the beginning, and combines it with the voluntary control introduced in NAL-9.
  # In software structure, it absorbs the ideas from previous discussions (such as in [AbstractDesignProposal], [Modules], [GUIRequest]) and implementations (the version built by Joe Geldart), as well as the recent discussions.
