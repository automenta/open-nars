#summary Description of the Video Examples

= Introduction =

There are already videos which show what OpenNARS is capable of.
Since Youtube supports timing, descriptions of the situations and a direct link is given:

= Make Light On =

This is a old simpler version of the "Make Light On in Closed Room"
example, which already the current release version OpenNARS 1.6.0
is able to do. However after release we played a lot with control mechanism ideas and tuning, with success, so for more complex examples like "Make Light On in Closed Room" the git version (which will result in 1.6.1 maybe soon) has to be used.


=Move to new place =

This example shows, how NARS generalizes
what it finds out about the go-to operations.
At first it recognizes,
after several go-tos,
that after go-to X, at X is relatively sure true. (first induction)
and then it recognizes that this always holds,
that this is not dependent on time.
With this knowledge it successfully moves
to a new place it was never before
just by getting told that it should be at this new place.
