#summary New functions of Open-NARS version 1.4.x.

= Introduction =

Open-NARS 1.4 add the last group of major functions into the system, including
  # real-time procedural inference
  # emotion and global indicators
  # self-monitor and self-control

In version 1.4.0, each of the above functions is implemented in its basic form. Until the functions are fully tested, the on-line demonstration will still be the previous stable version, 1.3.3, though the source code of 1.4.x will be uploaded from time to time.


= Real-time procedural inference =

Now the system takes the time interval between events into consideration, in terms of internal clock cycles. For example,
{{{
  IN: a. :|: %1.00;0.90% {0 : 0 : 1} 
5
  IN: b. :|: %1.00;0.90% {5 : 5 : 2} 
1
 OUT: <b =\> (&/,a,(^wait,5))>. %1.00;0.45% {6 : 1;2} 
 OUT: <(&/,a,(^wait,5)) =/> b>. %1.00;0.45% {6 : 1;2} 
 OUT: <(&/,a,(^wait,5)) </> b>. %1.00;0.45% {6 : 1;2} 
}}}
Here "^wait" is an operation that let the system anticipate a future event, after a given number of clock cycles. Such an anticipation will produce a (positive or negative) feedback, which will revise the belief about events implying each other.
{{{
<(&/,a,(^wait,5)) =/> b>.
a.
}}}
